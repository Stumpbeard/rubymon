# rubymon
Very basic and annoying digital pet to get up to speed on Ruby.

I wrote this in its entirety first, and then went and found a popular ruby linter and applied all of its rules.

10 line maximum on method seems like insanity to me, and I did break it, but regardless I did go and chop up my functions a lot more.
